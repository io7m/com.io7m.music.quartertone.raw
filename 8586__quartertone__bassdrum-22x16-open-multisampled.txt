A 1-shot sample taken of an unmuffled 22-inch diameter, 16-inch deep Remo Mastertouch bass drum, recorded with an internally mounted Equitek E100 close-mic and two Peavey electret condenser microphones in an XY pair. The drum was fitted with a Remo suede ambassador batter head and a Remo black logo front head with a 6-inch port. The instrument was played with a foot pedal-mounted nylon beater. The files are all 150,000 samples in length, and crossfade-looped with the loop range [100,000...149,999]. Samplers with .WAV file header support should automatically detect the loop range. Just enable looping, set the sample player's sustain parameter to 0% and use the decay and/or release parameter to fade the cymbal out to taste.
