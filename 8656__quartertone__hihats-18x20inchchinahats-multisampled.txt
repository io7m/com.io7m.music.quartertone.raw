A 1-shot sample taken of a special-effects HiHat cymbal combo stack (an 18-inch Zildjian A series Ping Ride as the top cymbal, and a 20-inch Wuhan Lion series China as the bottom cymbal), recorded with an MXL 603 close-mic and two Peavey electret condenser microphones in an XY pair. The files designated "FtSpl", "HO", "SO", and "O" are all 200,000 samples in length, and crossfade-looped with the loop range [150,000...199,999]. Samplers with .WAV file header support should automatically detect the loop range. Just enable looping, set the sample player's sustain parameter to 0% and use the decay and/or release parameter to fade the cymbals out to taste. A MIDI continuous-control number can be designated to modulate Amplitude Envelope Decay and/or Release parameters, as well as selection of the MIDI key to be triggered, corresponding to the strike zone/openness level of the instrument in appropriate hardware or software devices.
